    Don't add input event devices to the list that cannot be read.
    
    This fixes a crash caused by FD_SET() not liking a negative file descriptor.
    So also added a check right before FD_SET() just in case.

    Apply patch from Piotr Dlugosz making inputlircd robust against disappearing event devices.
    
    Date: Sun, 10 Apr 2011 17:15:44 +0200
    From: Piotr <pd_xl@wp.pl>
    Subject: Patch to make inputlircd crash proof
    
    I have the DVB card which sometimes crashes unfortunately. This card I'm
    using also for the remote control. When it crashes, the inputlirc goes
    down. It is not a problem to restart inputlirc but then I have to
    restart also other applications.
    
    I made small changes to the code:
    
    - Do not exit if there is a problem reading event device, just remember
      it was disconnected.
    - Every 30 secs when there is no activity try to reopen disconnected
      device (done via select timeout).

    Apply patch from Oliver Tscherwitschke fixing repeat flag.
    
    This prevents inputlirc from setting the repeat flag when different keys are
    pressed shortly after each other.

    Allow selecting input event devices by symbolic name.
    
    The -n option can be used to match devices by name. It allows wildcard patterns
    to be used.

    Apply slightly modified patch from David Härdeman adding a translation table.
    
    This allows keys to be given a different name, for example if one has an
    existing LIRC setup and one doesn't want to change all the client
    configurations.

    Reverse the order of initialisation of KEY_NAME[].
    
    This ensures keys which have more than one name to be reported as the first
    name found in input.h, instead of as one of their aliases. This fixes KEY_MUTE
    being reported as KEY_MIN_INTERESTING. Thanks to David Härdeman for spotting.

    Allow input devices to be grabbed for exclusive access (patch from Ian Campbell).
    Also remove input.h and use /usr/include/linux/input.h directly.
